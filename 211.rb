# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Write a while loop that prints the numbers 50 to 70.
number = 50
while number < 71
    puts number 
    number = number + 1
end


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I will practice array tomorrow.
